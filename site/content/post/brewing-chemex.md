For the past several weeks, my team and I have been working on a tool called
IRBeast. IRBeast is a tool that is intended to ease the IRB process, although
production of the tool is still in progress. The way it intends to do this is to
present the students with a list of statements. The statements are a combination
of IRB suggestions on what to do, and what things that they should avoid. For
example some statements advise people to explain any and all terminology to use.
While other statements advise the students on what to avoid(i.e advertising
without irb approval). This will be done by storing identifiers such as major
or student ID into the database that had been set up. The database will keep
record of how many statements the student was able to check off. And it will
also store how many times the irb request had been submitted.

This tool is important and convenient because it cuts down on the overall
irb process. Specifically, by giving students advice on what to include in their
IRB, it saves them time in the long run. Being informed in the beginning takes
considerably less time than having to make corrections after receiving their
IRB draft back. It also cuts down on the potential amount of things that students
could forget to include(i.e explanations of terminology). Additionally, it could
be used to inform people of what is not acceptable without prior IRB approval(i.e
advertising to organizations without IRB approval). Even though I found
this experience to be enjoyable, I struggled thoroughly with learning how to use
AWS. Specifically, I initially struggled with making the table and with doing
database integration. This was because I was very unfamiliar with aws, and it
was difficult for me to find tutorials that were relevant to this project.
Ultimately, I found this experience to be a very rewarding one. Especially
because it gave me more practice with AWS services and database systems in
general.

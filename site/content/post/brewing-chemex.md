For the past several weeks, my team and I have been working on a tool called
IRBeast. IRBeast is a tool that is intended to ease the IRB process, although
production of the tool is still in progress. The way it intends to do this is to
present the students with a list of statements. The statements are a combination
of IRB suggestions on what to do, and what things that they should avoid. For
example some statements advise people to explain any and all terminology to use.
While other statements advise the students on what to avoid(i.e advertising
without irb approval). This will be done by storing identifiers such as major
or student ID into the database that had been set up. The database will keep
record of how many statements the student was able to check off. And it will
also store how many times the irb request had been submitted.

1. Always buy dedicated Chemex filters.
2. Use a scale, don’t try to eyeball it.
3. Never skip preheating the glass.
4. Timing is key, don’t forget the clock.

The most visually distinctive feature of the Chemex is the heatproof wooden collar around the neck, allowing it to be handled and poured when full of hot water. This is turned, then split in two to allow it to fit around the glass neck. The two pieces are held loosely in place by a tied leather thong. The pieces are not tied tightly and can still move slightly, retained by the shape of the conical glass.

For a design piece that became popular post-war at a time of Modernism and precision manufacture, this juxtaposition of natural wood and the organic nature of a hand-tied knot with the laboratory nature of glassware was a distinctive feature of its appearance.

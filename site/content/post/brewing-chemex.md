For the past several weeks, my team and I have been working on a tool called
IRBeast. IRBeast is a tool that is intended to ease the IRB process, although
production of the tool is still in progress. The way it intends to do this is to
present the students with a list of statements. The statements are a combination
of IRB suggestions on what to do, and what things that they should avoid. For
example some statements advise people to explain any and all terminology to use.
While other statements advise the students on what to avoid(i.e advertising
without irb approval). This will be done by storing identifiers such as major
or student ID into the database that had been set up. The database will keep
record of how many statements the student was able to check off. And it will
also store how many times the irb request had been submitted.

EVen though I found this experience to be enjoyable, I struggled thoroughly with
learning how to use AWS. Specifically, I initially struggled with making the
table and with doing database integration. This was because I was very unfamiliar
with aws, and it was difficult for me to find tutorials that were relevant to
this project. Ultimately, I found this experience to be a very rewarding one.

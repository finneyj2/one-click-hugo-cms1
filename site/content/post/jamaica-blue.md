A description of my experiences working on the Gator Grouper tool
---

During this semester, I worked on contributing to the GatorGrouper tool. My
team was in charge of implementing a Markdown Parser for the tool. During this
time, I aided my team by both implementing new functions and creating skeletons
when necessary. And later, I updated the readme for the file so that the tool
could have proper documentation. Additionally, I also learned more about
markdown and python.

A description of my experiences working on the Gator Grader tool
---

During this semester, I worked on contributing to the GatorGrader tool. Gator
Grader is a tool that is used to automatically grade the assignments of students.
My team was in charge of implementing a Markdown Parser for the tool. The reason
why this was signficant was because the tool originally used regular expressions
to find paragraphs. However, my team replaced this approach with a feature
that used tags to find paragraphs instead. During this time, I aided my team by
both implementing new functions and creating skeletons when necessary.
And later, I updated the readme for the file so that the tool could have proper
documentation. Additionally, I also learned more about markdown and python. My
experiences also gave me important skills in regards to working within a larger
group. Despite the fact that this was an overall positive experience, there
were some hurdles for me. Specifically, initially I struggled to understand the
larger files that executed some core GatorGrader functions. However, after
using a multitude of approaches, I discovered that I was able to understand even
the large files fully if I broke them down into components. That way, I was
perceiving it as parts of a whole, instead of a large function that I had to
understand. And ultimately, it made me more confident in approaching bigger
files. This has led me to becoming more comfortable with using slack and gave me
an opportunity to see how useful the tool really was.

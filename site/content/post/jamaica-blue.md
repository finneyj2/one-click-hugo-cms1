A description of my experiences working on the Gator Grader tool
---

During this semester, I worked on contributing to the GatorGrader tool. Gator
Grader is a tool that is used to automatically grade the assignments of students.
My team was in charge of implementing a Markdown Parser for the tool. The reason
why this was signficant was because the tool originally used regular expressions
to find paragraphs. However, my team replaced this approach with a feature
that used tags to find paragraphs instead. During this time, I aided my team by
both implementing new functions and creating skeletons when necessary.
And later, I updated the readme for the file so that the tool could have proper
documentation. Additionally, I also learned more about markdown and python. My
experiences also gave me important skills.
